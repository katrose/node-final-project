    title: "Cross Manage by KAITO",
    summary: "In a post-Slam Dunk world, are there even any sports manga worth reading anymore? Cross Manage says YES.",
    body: "<h2>Summary</h2><img src='/img/blog/sakurai_misora.png' alt='Cross Manage Chapter 1 Panel' class='blog-img-1'><p>Sakurai is a 2nd year high school student who fears he’s become someone who just coasts through life (“a red bean bun without the beans”). He’s smart and picks things up easily, but he can’t seem to develop a passion for anything anymore, not after a knee injury forced him to give up a promising high school soccer career. That all changes when he meets Misora Toyoguchi, captain of the Fujioka Girls’ Lacrosse Club. They clash on their differing opinions about sports: Toyoguchi thinks you don’t need to be any good at a sport as long as you enjoy it, but Sakurai disagrees and thinks it’s all pointless unless you play to win. After he reluctantly coaches her on how to hit a target, she’s struck with an idea: he should join the Lacrosse Team as their manager!</p><h2>Impressions</h2><p>I’m trying to think of a single thing I don’t like about this comic and I’m coming up short. Everything about <em>Cross Manage</em> is delightful: the writing, the art, the humor, and most importantly, the characters. With all the crazy sports stuff going on–the grueling training sessions, the reluctant teammates, the rivals and the detractors–the bond between Sakurai and Misora is the glue that holds everything together. And it’s through this central relationship that Kaito explores some important questions: Is it possible to find purpose again after a great loss? Can hard work and determination trump innate skill? How far can one’s limits be pushed to achieve greater things?</p><blockquote><q>Everything about Cross Manage is delightful: the writing, the art, the humor, and most importantly, the characters.</q></blockquote><p>The secondary cast is just as entertaining as our main pair. A sports manga will inevitably have a shit ton of characters; it’s just part of the territory. And it can get pretty unwieldy. Fortunately, Kaito is amazing at characterization – all his characters have their own charms and quirks to distinguish themselves from one another. I really enjoyed the character designs for all the lacrosse players, which you can see in the image below.</p><img src='/img/blog/all-girls-team.png' alt='Cross Manage Character Designs 1' class='blog-img-2'><p>So yeah… I can’t help but wonder why <em>Cross Manage</em> was so unpopular at the time of its serialization. Were Jump readers just not into lacrosse or something? Did Kaito take too long explaining the mechanics of the sport? Maybe. It takes four chapters to get to the “action”, that is, actual scenes depicting lacrosse in play, and another chapter or two after that to explain some of the rules of the game. Maybe readers got impatient for the action and weren’t as charmed as I was by the character work in the early chapters.</p><p>Or maybe young dudes reading Jump didn’t like that Sakurai was the team manager–a supporting role normally filled by girls–and not the star of the lacrosse team himself? Who knows for sure? I can only speculate. These narrative decisions might have been a little risky, but I thought they were a breath of fresh air for a Weekly Shonen Jump title.</p><h2>How's the Translation?</h2><p>I think <em>Cross Manage</em> is one of Viz’s better efforts. The dialogue reads very naturally, like it’s actual teenagers talking to each other. There are no honorifics and there are no explanatory footnotes at all. Overall it feels like little adaptation was needed for a North American audience.</p><p>My only gripe is that the original Japanese sound effects are still intact here, with the English translation lettered next to them. I really dislike this practice, and unfortunately, this has long become the norm for a lot of manga publishers here. When the original SFX is left alone, it makes the book look sorta… incomplete. And unprofessional. Viz usually retouches the art for their books, but I noticed that they don’t for their digital-only releases, like their simulpubs. Which is fine. I’m OK with digital-only volumes not being lettered as long as the physical copies get the VIP treatment. (For a recent example, the early digital volumes of <em>One-Punch Man</em> did not have retouched art and re-lettering, but when Viz decided to go physical, they went all-out with the lettering and it looks sooooooooo good.)</p><p>Sadly I don’t see <em>Cross Manage</em> ever getting a hard copy release, so Viz is probably never gonna go back and letter it all. Oh well.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>The fact that <em>Cross Manage</em> kept ranking so poorly for nearly its entire run in Japan and was eventually cancelled by WSJ makes me wanna cry a little. For me, this story hits the spot in all the right ways: it has a perfect balance of action, drama, romance and humor. And it has a unique protagonist in Sakurai who gets a wonderful character arc even though he doesn’t take center stage in the lacrosse action. I really can't overstate what a great storytelling choice this was!</p><p>I think with a little more time, Kaito could have had a truly great title on his hands. There were some ideas that could have been explored a little more… and other characters could’ve been fleshed out… But for five volumes I think he did a pretty damn good job.</p>",

    title: "From Far Away by Kyoko Hikawa",
    summary: "A lovely isekai tale with one of the best male protagonists the genre has to offer.",
    body: "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Walking home from school one day, Noriko is transported to a strange, fantastical world. Alone and disoriented, she finds herself in the Sea of Trees, pursued by both monsters and humans for reasons she doesn't yet understand. She's rescued by Izark, a mysterious young warrior. As Noriko spends more time living in this new world and learning the language, she discovers that within Izark dwells an evil being called the Sky Demon. And according to ancient prophecy, Noriko was brought to this world as the Awakening, a being that possesses the power to unleash that demon.</p><h2>Review</h2><p>I am so glad Viz had a huge digital fantasy sale. I probably never would have gotten the chance to read this otherwise because it's sadly out of print.</p><p>The premise sounds a tiny bit similar to that of Red River, but the heroines being whisked away to faraway worlds is the only thing the two stories have in common. In terms of narrative and character development (and even artwork, but maybe that's a little more subjective), From Far Away is by far the superior manga. This is a story with a clear through line, with specific themes and ideas it wants to explore, and at 14 volumes, the pacing is just right.</p><h3>Highlights</h3><ul><li>Beautiful artwork, similar style to other manga in the same genre, but action scenes are really nice and fluid, good grasp of movement, something I don't really expect from a shojo manga (lol)</li><li>Romance between Noriko and Izark is well-written and incredibly moving</li><li>Izark's character development is the heart of the story - teaches self-acceptance, power to change one's destiny, overcoming one's inner darkness to find one's inner light</li><li>Worldbuilding is good</li><li>Villains are well-written, even sympathetic - author hints at redemption for them at the end</li></ul>",

    title: "QQ Sweeper by Kyousuke Motomi",
    summary: "Kyousuke Motomi's sophomore work about a supernatural \"cleaning\" duo!",
    body: "<h2>Impressions</h2><p>I looooooove Kyousuke Motomi. She wowed me with <span>Dengeki Daisy</span>, a title that on the surface might seem like standard rom-com fare, but is in reality a layered story about guilt and self-forgiveness.</p><p><span>QQ Sweeper</span>, though? I dunno. I wasn’t feeling it. I suppose I can’t knock on it too much knowing it’s actually a prequel, but stories that are part of a series should still be able to stand on their own, right?</p><h3>The Good</h3><ul><li>Motomi’s knack for protective, devoted male characters shows itself again here with the character of Kyutaro</li><li>Literal cleaning to demonstrate psychological cleaning, therapy, cleansing one’s mind, etc, is a unique and interesting idea</li><li>Kyutaro a standout character, very different from Kurosaki (Dengeki Daisy) – more vulnerable and willing to admit his loneliness; his love and pining for Fuyu/Fumi is really moving</li><li>Dengeki Daisy cameos were cute</li></ul><h3>The Bad</h3><ul><li>Motomi’s male protagonists all look the same!</li><li>Fumi's character isn't fleshed out very well and it makes the ending more jarring when we realize her role is going to change significantly in the story</li></ul><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Supernatural elements are unique but the story is boring mostly due to limp world-building and a lack of character development.</p>",

    title: "Red River by Chie Shinohara",
    summary: "Another sweepingly dramatic story about a girl being whisked to another world. But with less character development.",
    body: "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Yuri, a 15-year-old Japanese schoolgirl, gets transported to ancient Anatolia by an evil queen who needs her for a blood sacrifice in order to place her son on the throne. Luckily for Yuri, Prince Kail comes to her rescue. A renowned sorcerer himself, Kail promises to send Yuri back to her own time, but the queen’s schemes keep getting in the way. Stuck in Anatolia, Yuri must navigate a foreign world full of intrigue and danger as she tries to find a way back home.</p><h2>Review</h2><p>Viz is coming out with digital sales for their older shojo fantasy titles in honor of Yona of the Dawn debuting in North America! So I went ahead and splurged on Red River. While I do love to see physical copies on my shelf, these older titles have been out of print for years and it’s way too much of a hassle to track down affordable copies where I live.</p><p>So anyway, Red River. This thing’s a classic, yes? Not hard to see why. It’s got adventure in a foreign land and a grand love story – and the 90’s shojo art style makes everything look so dramatic and romantic. It’s easy to get swept away by it all.</p><p>That’s all the good I have to say about it, though… ‘cuz honestly I wasn’t really feeling this one much. After a few volumes the story begins to feel very repetitive. There are a bunch of reasons why this is the case:</p><p><strong>Nakia is a boring villain.</strong> This matters a lot because she’s the main source of conflict for the whole story. We don’t understand her motivation until late in the story and even then all we get are a few cursory flashbacks. A series this long should have spent more time exploring her character to add some much-needed nuance to the central conflict.</p><p><strong>The protagonists are too passive.</strong> Nakia pretty much drives the entire story. She’s always the one taking initiative and the heroes merely react to her schemes. What’s most irritating is that the heroes find out early on that she’s behind all the crazy shit happening, and yet they do zilch to stop her until the very last minute.</p><p><strong>Yuri is... too perfect.</strong> This is my main beef with Red River. I’m supposed to believe that a 20th century teenager suddenly becomes a master equestrian and sword fighter, can lead an entire army into complicated military maneuvers, and have a bunch of powerful men fall in love with her instantly and claim her for their own? And despite Yuri being able to command elite soldiers and an entire army, she still gets captured all the fucking time. WHO ON EARTH MADE HER IN CHARGE OF THE ARMY WHEN SHE CAN’T EVEN MANAGE BASIC SELF-DEFENSE?!?! Ugh, whatever.</p><p>I’m making it sound like all of Red River is horrible and that couldn’t be further from the truth. The love story between Yuri and Kail is nice, and Kail’s devotion to Yuri is actually quite moving. There are some memorable secondary characters, too. But overall… I’d be lying if I said I enjoyed this manga. Perhaps I expected too much. Red River is okay for light reading but if you’re wanting something more complex when it comes to character development and conflict, I’d look elsewhere.</p>",
